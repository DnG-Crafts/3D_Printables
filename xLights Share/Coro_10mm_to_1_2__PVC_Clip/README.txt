# Summary

This is a standoff bracket clip that mounts to 10mm coro decorations to allow mounting them to 1/2" SCH40 PVC pipe stands or mounts.

I used #8 1-1/4" stainless machine screws just because thats what I had on hand.  A 1" screw will do fine.

The hole in the main bracket is purposefully small to allow you to drill it out to accept the size screw you have on hand.

Drill a 1/2" hole in your coro decoration.  Pop in the bushing from the front.  Place washer on screw and attach bracket to back.  Do not over tighten the screw or you will strip out the plastic.  Snug is good enough.

The bushing is there to keep you from crushing the coro when you tighten the screw.

I designed this for Boscoyo ChromaBulb decorations but it should be useful for any decoration made from 10mm coroplast.
