UPDATED NOTES (Sep 2020):
Updated part file contains edits to:
The base/feet
	Added thickness to the base to prevent breaking while pounding stakes and cracking under high wind loads.
The upright wall thickness
	Added thickness so slicers are able to add infill. Old design was too close that slicers could not put infill there. 
Screw Hole Size
	Same screw sizes before but tolerance was loosened to accommodate screws without drilling. 
New screw size
	The length of the EMT mounting screw was increased to ensure that the screw can pass through the part (1/4 Washers between the screw head and part are recommended)
