# Summary

This is a jig for rapidly seating square type pixels in a boscoyo strip.  See this video on use:

I recommend you print this at .3mm layers with 50% infill for strength.  I printed mine out of ABS but PLA is probably a viable material as well.

After I got my routine down, it takes me about 12:30 to seat 60 pixels AND do a 4 wiretie splice to connect 2 strips together.  Thats nearly 5 strips per hour.  And thats just a leisurely pace.  I wasn't racing, just getting it done.  And thats with no hurting fingers!
